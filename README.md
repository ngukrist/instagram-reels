Hi! This is a small project I did one summer when I was bored and spending too much time on my phone...

I requested data from Instagram that contained my messages, which I cleaned and converted into a .csv in 
the ig_posts.ipynb notebook in python. Then, I did more tidying and the visualizations in the ig_reels.R 
script. I have visualizations I got from 2024 as a sample :)
